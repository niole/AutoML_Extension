# TODO

# feature changes
- shouldn't install node at runtime
- training job doesn't use the right env, uses DSE
- how to deal with transient errors in training jobs, which resulted in the job failing?
- how is local development? requirements would get out of sync with the environment, maybe we should download the 
requirements from the github repo when building the Dockerfile

# dockerfile changes
- verify numpy removal
- verify model serving requirements removal
- test doing eda with dataset
- test making registered model with job

# dev
- understand how jobs are launched
- there is an active domino jobs setting...probably useful for the in memory "jobs", for domino jobs though?
- job creation in sqlite db can fail and result in inconsistent state between domino and local db, job_service.py,
need to verify that test_job_service covers this for create_job_with_context
- does the code that launches the job use the right env?
- test advanced configuration in job launching
